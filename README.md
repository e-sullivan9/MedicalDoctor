GUI project II
CSCI 400

-Project II-

 

Project Overview:

You and your team members will simulate to develop the software called “Medical Doctor”.  The software will be used in hospital for managing and updating not only the patient information but also prescription, and other physical test.  The software should be developed with well-designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) so that medical doctors can easily access and manage the patient information.

 

Program Contents:

The “Medical Doctor” software should have following contents on GUI:

 Registration – this section will record personal information of the patient such as “Age”, “Gender”, “Address”, and Medical Insurance”.
General Practice – this section will record the patient history taking as follows:
Chief Complaint (this includes onset of the symptom)
Present illness 
Past history
Review of the system (this section will record the patient’s subjective symptom)
Physical Exam (this section will record the patient’s objective finding by doctor)
Impression (this section will record the patient’s suspicious diagnosis)
Diagnosis by doctor
Laboratory Test – this section will give the order for the following:
Hematologic Laboratory
Red blood cell
White blood cell
Liver function test
Renal function test
Electrolyte test
Radiologic Laboratory
X-ray
Computed Tomography (CT)
Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)
Urinary Test
Stool Test
Prescription (this section will give prescription to patient)
Injection
Intramuscular injection (IM)
Intravascular injection (IV)
Subcutaneous injection (SC)
P.O (Per Os;  Oral medication )
Nursing
This section will display the prescription from doctor, and suppose to give information to patient.  This section will also record the practice of nursing activity.

 

Program Flow:

Patient register à see a doctor à a doctor review patient’s registration info. à Fill in the general practice à nurses get prescription for the patient à patient gets test, and prescription

 

Important Notes:

All data should be saved and managed by database.
The searching functionality should be given in the program. (for example:  follow-up visit)
Print prescription function should be implemented.
The GUI should be well-designed and easy to access. (Ugly and messy design will not get any points)
Security for each section should be implemented (registration, general prescription, and nursing should have different login and password).  
No individual work is allowed.  It means that anyone who is working on this project individually will get 0 points.  You must work with your team members.
The team must be formed at 3/12/2015 before the class is end (by 6;30 P.M.).  Maximum number of a team is 4.
If you are absent on 3/12/2015, you must submit official document to join the team.  Otherwise, you will get 0 point for this project.
 

Project Due Date: April 30, 2015(Thursday) by 4:30 P.M.

 

Grade:  Program – 70%

             Presentation – 30%

 

Submission:  All your program except .class files must be zipped, and submit through blackboard.  Your ppt slide must be printed and submit to the instructor on presentation day.

 

Important Announcement:

The team(s) who are ranked first shall receive the full 100 points, those ranked second shall earn a base 85 points, and those ranked next to receive 70 points and so on. It is likely that several teams will be ranked together.  Make no mistake -- this is a competition! The quality of your presentation as well as your program design including GUI shall determine the ranking.
The medical doctor will review your program and presentation.
